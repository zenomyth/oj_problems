The minimum diameter spanning tree (MDST, 最小直径生成树) problem.

Find vertex 1-center (The point on some edge with minimal maximum distance to farthest vertex) of the graph.
Find the shortest-path tree (最短路径树) from the vertex 1-center.

Vertex 1-center: Find the minimum of lowest point in the saw-tooth curve for each edge according to ref/distance_from_points_on_edge_to_vertices.jpg

Distance matrix: Floyd–Warshall algorithm

Shortest path tree: Dijkstra’s algorithm
