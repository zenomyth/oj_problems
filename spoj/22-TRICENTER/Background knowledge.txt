Heron's formula: A = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), s is semi-perimeter
Centroid is denoted as G
Orthocenter is denoted as H
Circumradius is denoted as R
Circumdiameter is denoted as d
Area is denoted as A
GH is on Euler line
GH = sqrt(4 * R^2 - 4 * (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) / 9)
Distance from G to edges are denoted as ga, gb, gc.
Since the area of AGB, BGC and CGA is the same, we have this formula: a * ga = b * gb = c * gc
Law of sines: d = a / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin (C)
Area formula with height: A = a * b * sin (C) / 2
From the above: R = d / 2 = a * b * c / (4 * A)
